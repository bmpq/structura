# Structura
This is a blender addon that connects rigidbodies with constraint joints. It places the joints automatically based on a configurable contact point detection.

This addon also lets you create custom colliders for each rigidbody (Compound Parent). This feature is helpful when you need to fine-tune the colliders en masse.
